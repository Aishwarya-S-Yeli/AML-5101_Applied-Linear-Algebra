It is widely used in pharmaco-kinetics, the study of how the concentration of a drug varies over time in the body. In this application, the material is a drug, and the compartments are the bloodstream, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and so on. Compartmental systems are special cases of linear dynamical systems. In this problem we will consider a very simple compartmental system with $3$ compartments. We let $(x_t)_i$ denote the amount of the material (say, a drug) in compartment $i$ at time stamp $t.$ Between time stamps $t$ and $t+1,$ the material moves as follows:\n","\n","* 20% of the material in compartment 1 moves to compartment 2.
